# Planet
This is my first `Unity3D` program. I am following tutorials by Sebastian Lague, which you can see from Reference link.

The final goal of this project is building a program that creates 3D planets with `Unity`.

Sphere is created by first creating a cube covered with triangular meshes and by inflating the surface by changing the vertex lengths to be uniform.
